## Why Vero?

> **Make it easy for small and mid-sized organizations to adopt a modern, open, and self-hosted analytics stack — without giving up control.**

Too many organizations face the same challenges:

- Complex and costly vendor ecosystems
- Rigid tools that don’t adapt to your workflow
- “Black box” SaaS platforms that obscure what's really happening under the hood
- **Pushing sensitive internal data to external vendors just to generate a chart**
- A lack of data sovereignty and limited infrastructure ownership

Vero was built to solve that — with a **clean reference architecture** and a commitment to open, modular design.

### 🚀 Our Goals:

- **Easy replication**: Provide a production-grade analytics stack that’s understandable, testable, and easy to deploy.
- **Open-source + vendor-neutral**: Use well-documented OSS tools — no hidden fees or lock-in.
- **Data sovereignty**: Run everything on your own servers. Keep internal data internal.
- **Modern stack**: Built on today’s best practices — modular, scalable, and cloud-friendly.
- **Accessible to teams**: Usable by data engineers, analysts, and non-technical stakeholders alike.

With Vero, you’re not just consuming analytics — you **own the full pipeline**, from ingestion to insight.
